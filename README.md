Liquidity Velocity Token (LVT) is an innovative Solana-based program designed to incentivize high-frequency traders (HFTs), market makers, and liquidity providers (LPs). By dynamically adjusting fees and distributing rewards based on trading activity, execution speed, and liquidity contribution, LVT aims to enhance decentralized liquidity markets.
